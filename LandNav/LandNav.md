## Tools of the Trade

### The Map

#### General
##### Different Map Layers

##### Natural Features (of Military Significance)

##### Manmade Features

##### Points of Reference

#### Contour Lines of Topographic Maps

* Red Line 5 m apart 

* Each Line represents a standard hight above sea Lines

* When contour lines are closer togehter, this means that the gradient is steep. The closer the lines, the steeper the gradient.

* When contour lines are further apart, the terrain is flatter.

* Hilltops

##### Hill
A point or small area of high ground.
When on a hilltop, the ground slopes down in all directions.

##### Ridge
A line of high ground with height variations along its crest.
The ridge is not simply a line of hills; allpoints of the ridge crest are higher than the ground on both sides of the ridge.

##### Valley
Reasonably level ground bordered on the sides by higher ground which usually has maneurver room within its confines.

##### Draw
Siumilar to a valley, except that normally it is less developed stream course in which there is generally no level ground and, therefore, little or no maneuver room. The groud slopes upward on each side and toward the head of the draw.

##### Spur
A usually short, continuously sloping line of higher ground, normally jutting out from the side of a ridge.
A spur could be considered as the high ground that helps create a draw.

---

#### Map Grids

##### Grid Coordinates
Grid Coordinates consists of two sets numbers
Grid Coordinates are always given in the same order: "Read Right, then Up".

First set of numbers designate the longitute, the horizontal distance across the map.
The reference numbers (grids) increase from left to right.

Latitude -  Bottom to Top
Secound set of number designate the latitute, the vertical distance up the map. Bottom to the Top.

When delivering Grid Coorinates verbally, the two sets of digits are being seperated with "break"

##### Digits
 The more Digits used, the more accurate a position can be determined.
 4 Digits: 00 break 00 = 1000m by 1000m 
 6 Digits: 000 break 000 = 100m by 100m 
 8 Digits: 0000 break 0000 = 10m by 10m 
10 Digits: 00000 break 00000 = 1m by 1m


##### Keypad Reference
In certain circumstances, it is tideous to acquire the more detailed Digits needed for a 8 or 10 Digit Coordinate.
Since ArmA's ingame Map only scales up to 6 Digits, it can be easier and faster to give a more detailed reference with a Keypad Reference.

Take the normal 6 Digits Gridsquare on the map and (mentally) seperate it by it into 3 Parts on each axis resulting in 9 SubSquares.

Then assign the Numbers 1 to 9 to the individual SubSquares, beginning in the bottom, left to right.
This is in Refernce with the KeyPad Layout, like your Keyboards Numpad on the right.

```
7 8 9
4 5 6
1 2 3
```

Example:

123 break 123 key 5 - Center of the GridSquare.
123 break 123 key 1 - Bottom Left.
123 break 123 key 7 - Top Left.

### The Map Tools (ACE)
#### Features of Map Tool
##### Leading Line
A long red Line that runs long the lengh of the map
##### Grid Tool
Two rulers perpendicular (90Â°) to each other - used for more detailed GridReferences
##### Ruler
Used To messure Distances on the Map
##### Center
The Map tool Pivots around this center point
##### Compass

#### Moving the Map tool
A) Cursor over the MapTool, hold **Left Mouse Button** to drag the Tool over the Map

B) To Rotate the Map Tool, use **Left Alt Key** and **LMB** on anything outside the Maptools Compass

#### Calculating a Route Between two Points

1. Identify A and B on the Map
2. Determine Bearing - Position Point A on the CenterPoint and Rotate MapTool until the red Leadingline aligns with Point B
3. Measure Distance - Drag MapTool, without changing the Compass Direction, so Point A and B is on the Side Ruler. Read Distance - One full Step is 1.000m, devided into 100m Steps and more.    

* Assuming a man can complete 100 meters in approximately one minute, you can estimate time of travel.

### The Compass
#### Degree
A compass is divided into 360 degress and is the most common unit of measurement
#### Mils
Another unit of mesurement found on a compass, used mainly by militaries in artillery, tank and mortar gunnery. Circle devided into 64 Parts.

#### Some Mods' Compass will only update on the Map once you took it in your hand (Used with "K")
