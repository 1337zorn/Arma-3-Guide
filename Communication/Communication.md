#### Faction Encyrption

A Side's/Faction's Radio can only Communicate with a Radio of the same Faction as they Data is encrypted.
When you Pick up a Radio of an Hostile Player in an PvP Environment, you can Listen in on their Communication with their Radio. 


### How to Use the Radios

#### Buttons

You open your Radio with **L CTRL + P** for the Handheld Versions / Short Range Versions.

You open your Radio with **L ALT + P** for the Backpack / Vehicle / Long Range Versions.

This will show you the Panel of the Radio. Each Radio has Buttons which will Highlight their Function when you Hover over them.

![Example of Highlight](img/button-highlight.jpg)


With these Buttons you can

- Change Channels
- Change Volume (LMB/RMB)
- Clear Frequency
- Set Additional Channel
- Set Frequency
- Set Stereo Settings of the Headset
- Turn Switch from Headset and Speaker

#### Channels

Every Radio can store 9 Channels. C1 - C9.

Each of this Channels has a Frequency assigend which you can change on the go.

To Change a Frequency you 
A) Hit **Clear Frequency** - Enter New Fequency - Confirm with **Set Frequency**
B) Click on the Frequency itself in the Display - Enter New Frequency - Confirm with **Set Frequency**

The Channel selected or seen in the display is the Main Channel.

The selected Main Channel is you will use to Transmit and Recieve Radio Traffic.

To **Transmit** a message on your Short Range Radio you hold **Left Shift**.

To **Transmit** a message on your Long Range Radio you hold **L CTRL + Left Shift**.

#### Stereo Settings

With the **Stereo Settings** Button you can change on which side of your headset the Radio Communication will be played.

Both Sides, Left or Right.

**It is highly recommended to always seperate your radio communication in an consistant manner**
For Example, I always have SquadNet or ShortRange on the Left Ear and CommandNet or LongRange on the Right Ear.


#### Additional Channel

Most Radios, with the exception of the Rifleman Radios, have  to option to also set up an Additional Channel.

What you do is to set one of your channels as the Additional Channel. It will Show itself as A2: 123 instead of C2: 123.

You can also use the Stereo Settings for your Additional Channel to seperate Headphone Output.

Once you have set up the Additional Channel, you need to change your Main Channel to the desired Channel.

![Example of a Radio set up with an Additional Channel](img/Headset.png)


#### Speaker

You can set your Radio to Output the Radio Communication with its built in Speaker. This means that people around you can hear what is being said on the Frequency.

Doing this as a Rifleman in a squad is very bad, as the people around you are already on the same Radio, resulting in EarRape.

On the other hand, being the Squadleader or dedicated Radio Operator, it can be a reasonable decision to set your Long Range Radio on Speaker to keep people around you updated on what is going on in the Battle Field.

## Radio Dicipline or how to communicate without causing headaches

### Core concepts of Radio Voice Communication

**Brevity** 
It is the art of saying a lot with few words. One must alwys strive to be frugal on the number of words needed to convey a message - there's a lot that needs to be said by many people in a combat.

**Clarity**
In Addition to brevity, one must strive to be very clear in their language. This requires the usage of defined tactical language terms, brevity words, aclear and loud voice, and so forth. Articulation and repetition of critical statements is helpful as well.

**Confirmation and read-back**
It's important to confirm that you heard orders, so that leaders know that they are being understood. Additionally, it can be helpful to provide a read back of an order to confirm that you fully understand what is being asked of you. This way the person giving the orders can confirm that you heard them correctly.

**Alerting and identifying**
Alerting is the act of using key words to get the attention of people before you start saying something important. 
For example, a squad leader might say "Squad, listen up!". 

Identifying is the act of saying who you are and who you're trying to contact when speaking over a radio. This reduces confusion and alerts people that someone is attempting to tell them something.
For example, a SQL saying "Alpha, this is Bravo, be advised, you have enemy infantry on your west flank" is utilizing the "alert/identify concept". 

When things are hectic, it's ofte n a good idea to state your callsign and who you are trying to reach, then allow them to answer you when they're able.
Example: "Alpha, this is Bravo" - Waiting until they say "Bravo, this is Alpha, send it" or short "Bravo - send it" before continuing with your full message.

**Usage of standard operating procedures and tactical language**
Being familiar with the standard formats of SITREPs, CASREPs, contact reports, etc, as well as being familiar with the wide range of brevity word and tactical terms, helps to ensure that communication is easy to understand by all involved participants.
