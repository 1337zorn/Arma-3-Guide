# How to Be a good Mashine Gunner

More Daka is better Daka

Now that the most important stuff is said...


... lets get into details


Anyone can pick up an mg and call himself a machine gunner or autorifleman, and that’s pretty true. It isn’t that hard to do. Not difficult to learn, but it can be difficult to get good at.

1. Environmental Awareness - Identifying buildings, defilade, and various elevated positions to make your nest in, and being aware of the enemy’s movements from cover to cover.

2. Positioning - Just because a building or hill may look like a good position from one angle, doesn’t mean it will be that good when you get there. You want to place yourself in a position with a wide field of vision with as little cover and concealment between you and the enemy as possible. Be sure to keep cover to your left and right in case someone sneaks past your firing arc and flanks you.

3. Ammo Conservation - Just because you have a 200 round belt doesn’t mean you need to burn it all as fast as you can. Fire in five to ten round bursts and see where your shots are landing. You have a lot of ammo, but you can burn it faster than anyone in the squad. Not only that but it can overheat your barrel and drastically reduce your accuracy.

4. Assistants - Every good Autorifleman or Machine Gunner needs a good assistant to not only provide security and help keep the gunner in question safe, but to carry the extra ammo they need so the gunner doesn’t overload their weight. Assistants can link a gunner’s belt to another while they are firing via ACE, and the link/reload takes around three seconds as opposed to the five to ten seconds of reloading on your own. They can even carry a spare barrel for you in the event you melt your current one.

5. Close Range Engagements - Aiming and firing a machine gun without setting it up is hit or miss at best. The rate of fire and ludicrous recoil mean you’ll have a hard time to just spray someone. Firing from the hip can have a better success rate than aiming down sights when you have 100 or more rounds to put downrange if the target is within 50m or less.
